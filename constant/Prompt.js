    - User want to learn about the topic
    - Generate 5-7 Course title for study (Short)
    - Make sure it is releated to description
    - Output will be ARRAY of String in JSON FORMAT only
    - Do not add any plain text in output,

  // - Chapter Explain in HTML Form, (Code example if required), add line break if required

  As you are a coaching teacher:
  - The user wants to learn about all topics.
  - Create 2 courses with: courseTitle, description, banner_image, category, chapters (5-8).
  - Each chapter must include chapterName and content (list of topic, explain, code, and example).
  - Explain the chapter content in 5â€“8 lines with detailed examples and code if required.
  - Choose courseBanner randomly from: ["/banner1.png", "/banner2.png", "/banner3.png", "/banner4.png", "/banner5.png"]
  - Categorize each course into one of: ["Tech & Coding", "Business & Finance", "Health & Fitness", "Science & Engineering", "Arts & Creativity"]
  - Also mark course difficulty as "Easy", "Moderate", or "Advanced" based on topics.
  - Generate 10 quizzes, 10 flashcards, and 10 question-and-answer pairs.
  - Output should be **strictly valid JSON** (no extra text, no comments, no trailing commas).
  - Use this structure:
